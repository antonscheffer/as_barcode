# as_barcode

No documentation available  
See this [APEX demo](https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=156013)

I use that application also to develop and test this package. So it might be possible that the demo shows more than can be done with the lastest version available at github, for instance PDF417. And that application itself is NOT available.

Supports QR-code, Aztec, data matrix, EAN-8, EAN-13, UPC-A, code39, code128, Interleaved 2 of 5 (ITF) and some (RM4SCC, Australia Post 4-State Customer Code, KIX) postal 4-State barcodes
